    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my project! I embarked on this journey with a clear mission: to support musicians in their practice and learning journeys. As a guitarist myself, I understand the importance of having access to the right tools and resources. That's why I created this application to provide a all-in-one solution for all the utilities needed to enhance your practice sessions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, I strongly believe in the power of open source and accessibility. By offering this tool as a free and open-source resource, I aim to break down barriers and make musical education accessible to everyone. You can find the source code for this project on my GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rnd00m" target="_blank">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond that, my goal is to foster a sense of community among guitarists and bassists worldwide. Through this project, I hope to share knowledge and contribute to the vibrant community of guitarists and bassists.
