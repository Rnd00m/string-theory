    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      This application has been developed to help guitarists of all levels to
      learn music theory and practice applied to guitar and bass.
    </p>
    <!--      It also provides useful tools such as a tuner.-->

    <p>
      It is a personal project with no commercial purpose. It is planned to
      become open source to allow other developers to contribute to its
      evolution.
